Python has two main built-in numeric classes that implement the integer and floating point data types. 
These Python classes are called 
-[]int and 
--[]float. 

The standard arithmetic operations, +, −, *, /, and ** (exponentiation), remainder (modulo) operator, %, and integer division, //.

Operation Name Operator Explanation
less than < Less than operator
greater than > Greater than operator
less than or equal <= Less than or equal to operator
greater than or equal >= Greater than or equal to operator
equal == Equality operator
not equal =! Not equal operator

logical and and Both operands True for result to be True
logical or or Either operand True for result to be True
logical not not Negates the truth value: False becomes True, True becomes False
Table 1.1: Relational and Logical Operators

The boolean data type, implemented as the Python bool class, will be quite useful for
representing truth values. The possible state values for a boolean object are True and False
with the standard boolean operators, and, or, and not.


Operation Name Operator Explanation
indexing [ ] Access an element of a sequence
concatenation + Combine sequences together
repetition * Concatenate a repeated number of times
membership in Ask whether an item is in a sequence
length len Ask the number of items in the sequence
slicing [ : ] Extract a part of a sequence
